Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Receptor-Ligand Complexes
===========================================================

In this directory, we keep files associated with with the simulation of
receptor-ligand complexes, as described by J. Lemkul [[1]](#1). Since here we
need to use web services for almost all complexes, no script is provided;
however, the topology (`.top`, `.itp`) files, as well as, when needed, parameter
files (`.prm`), are provided. Supplied in this directory are also coordinate
files (`.gro`) and command files (`.mdp`).
